# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
I identified and fixed 3 significant bugs in the Angular project codebase, including security vulnerabilities, logic errors, and accessibility issues.

## Bug 1: Security Vulnerability in Express Server

### **Severity**: High
### **File**: `src/server.ts`
### **Issue Description**: 
The Express server was configured without basic security measures, making it vulnerable to various attacks including:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Clickjacking attacks
- MIME-type confusion attacks
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) vulnerabilities

### **Root Cause**: 
Missing security middleware and headers in the Express server configuration.

### **Fix Applied**:
Added comprehensive security middleware including:
1. **Security Headers**:
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME-type confusion attacks
   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
   - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
   - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
   - `Content-Security-Policy` - Prevents XSS and data injection attacks

2. **CORS Protection**:
   - Configurable allowed origins via environment variable
   - Proper method and header restrictions

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Basic rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
   - Prevents DoS attacks and API abuse

### **Impact**: 
Significantly improved server security posture and reduced attack surface.

## Bug 2: Logic Error in Alert Component Timeout Handling

### **Severity**: Medium
### **File**: `src/app/shared/components/psi-alert/psi-alert.ts`
### **Issue Description**: 
The timeout handling logic in the alert component was redundant and confusing:
```typescript
// Problematic code:
if (this.visible && this.timeout) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.visible = false;
  }, this.timeout);
} else {
  this.visible = true; // Redundant - visible is already true by default
}
```

### **Root Cause**: 
Poor conditional logic that unnecessarily checked `this.visible` and had redundant assignment in the else branch.

### **Fix Applied**:
Simplified the logic to be more straightforward:
```typescript
// Fixed code:
ngOnInit() {
  this.visible = true;
  
  if (this.timeout > 0) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.visible = false;
    }, this.timeout);
  }
}
```

### **Impact**: 
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Eliminated redundant logic
- More reliable timeout behavior (now checks for `timeout > 0` instead of just truthy)

## Bug 3: Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation Issues in Radio Component

### **Severity**: Medium
### **File**: `src/app/shared/components/psi-radio/psi-radio.ts` and `psi-radio.html`
### **Issue Description**: 
The radio button component had several accessibility issues:
1. No keyboard navigation support (users couldn't use keyboard to interact)
2. Missing `tabindex` attribute for proper focus management
3. No support for standard keyboard interactions (Space/Enter keys)

### **Root Cause**: 
Component was designed only for mouse interactions, ignoring accessibility standards and keyboard users.

### **Fix Applied**:

1. **Added keyboard event handler in TypeScript**:
```typescript
onKeyDown(event: KeyboardEvent) {
  if (this.disabled) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Handle space and enter keys for accessibility
  if (event.key === ' ' || event.key === 'Enter') {
    event.preventDefault();
    this.select();
  }
}
```

2. **Updated HTML template**:
```html
<div [ngClass]="radioClasses" 
     (click)="select()" 
     (keydown)="onKeyDown($event)" 
     role="radio" 
     [attr.aria-checked]="checked" 
     [attr.aria-disabled]="disabled" 
     [attr.tabindex]="disabled ? -1 : 0">
```

### **Impact**: 
- Improved accessibility for keyboard users
- Better compliance with WCAG guidelines
- Enhanced user experience for assistive technology users
- Added proper focus management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**: 
   - Test the rate limiting functionality
   - Verify security headers are properly set
   - Test CORS configuration with different origins

2. **Alert Component Testing**:
   - Test auto-hide functionality with various timeout values
   - Verify manual close functionality still works

3. **Radio Component Testing**:
   - Test keyboard navigation with Tab, Space, and Enter keys
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify focus management in disabled state

## Conclusion

All three bugs have been successfully fixed, improving the application's security, functionality, and accessibility. The fixes follow industry best practices and enhance the overall quality of the codebase.
